// Backend-neutral data types crossing the Core/Adapter seam.

// `UIElement` describes a clickable thing in the frontmost app: its
// on-screen frame (so the overlay can position a label), a role tag,
// an optional title (for debugging / diagnostics), and an opaque
// `id` the adapter uses to look the live AX handle up at dispatch
// time. Core must never touch AX directly — same policy as facet's
// `Window` vs adapter-side `RFWorkspace`.
