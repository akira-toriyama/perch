# perch — architecture

perch is a keyboard-driven UI navigator for macOS. Activate via
hotkey → AX-enumerate the frontmost app's focused window → label
every clickable element → type a label to fire
`AXUIElementPerformAction(_, kAXPressAction)`.

The split into **Core / Adapter / App** is the central design
idea (same shape as
[stroke](https://github.com/akira-toriyama/stroke) and
[facet](https://github.com/akira-toriyama/facet)): the pure-logic
core knows nothing about AX, Carbon, or AppKit, so it can be
driven equally by a real `AXUIElementSource` (`PerchAdapterMacOS`)
or by a fixture (`SyntheticUIElementSource` in
`PerchAdapterTest`) in unit tests.

`PerchCore` defines `UIElementSource` — the protocol that emits
labelable elements and accepts a `press(id:)` call. The Controller
only ever sees `UIElementSource`. Real vs synthetic is picked at
app startup.

## The activation flow

```
hotkey shift+space  (or `perch --activate` over DNC)
  │
  ▼
Controller.activate()
  │
  ├─ source.enumerate()                  ← AX walk in Adapter,
  │                                        runs the filter chain
  │                                        (see "AX filter chain")
  ▼
Labeler.assign(elements, alphabet,
               prioritiseCenter,
               screenSize) → [Hint]      ← pure logic, fully tested
  │
  ▼
overlay.show(hints) { resolved, action ← installs KeyTap
    in                                   (CGEventTap),
    source.act(id: resolved.element.id, orderFront panel,
               as: action)               returns immediately
}
  │
  ▼  user types "as"  (KeyTap swallows the keys; perch is
  │                    NEVER frontmost, so the target app
  │                    keeps focus. Modifier held during the
  │                    resolving keystroke selects the action
  │                    mode — see "Action modes" below.)
  ▼
Labeler.resolve(hints, "as") → Hint
  │
  ▼
source.act("1234:7", as: action)
  │  .press      → AXUIElementPerformAction(_, kAXPressAction)
  │  .rightClick → AXUIElementPerformAction(_, kAXShowMenuAction)
  │  .focus      → AXUIElementSetAttributeValue(_, kAXFocusedAttribute, true)
  │  .copyTitle  → NSPasteboard.general ← element's title
  ▼
(focus is still where it was — perch never activated, so AXPress
 lands without a focus dance and `.copyTitle` doesn't disturb the
 user's caret)
```

Every clickable element gets a stable id within one enumeration
(`"\(pid):\(seq)"`). The adapter keeps a side-table
`[id: AXUIElement]` so `act(id:as:)` can look the live AX handle
up at dispatch time. The id is *not* stable across enumerations
— the side-table is cleared at the top of every `enumerate()`.

### Action modes

Modifiers held during the *resolving* keystroke pick the action.
Hint enumeration / overlay rendering are identical across modes;
only the dispatch verb at the end differs:

| Modifier | `HintAction` | AX call |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `.press` | `kAXPressAction` (left-click equivalent) |
| `Shift` | `.rightClick` | `kAXShowMenuAction` (context menu) |
| `Cmd` | `.copyTitle` | `kAXTitle` (or `kAXValue`) → `NSPasteboard.general` |
| `Alt` | `.focus` | `kAXFocusedAttribute = true` (focus only, no fire) |
| `Cmd+Shift` | `.pressContinuous` | `kAXPressAction` + Controller re-enters hint mode (continuous-follow) |

`Ctrl` is reserved for the user's own shortcuts (Ctrl-C / system
bindings) and exits hint mode without swallowing the keystroke.

## The labeling algorithm

[Sources/PerchCore/Labeler.swift](../Sources/PerchCore/Labeler.swift)
assigns one or two-letter labels from a configurable alphabet:

- **≤ |alphabet| elements**: single-letter labels in alphabet order.
- **> |alphabet| elements**: reserve the *tail* of the alphabet as
  "prefix letters" — those letters appear **only** as the first
  character of a two-letter label, never as a single-letter label
  in their own right. The single-letter and two-letter spaces stay
  disjoint, so typing the first character of a two-letter label
  can never momentarily collide with a single-letter label.

The disjoint invariant is the same trick Vimium uses (see
References → Inspiration in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)).

With `prioritise-center = true`, elements closer to the screen
midpoint get the earlier (home-row) letters. The reorder only
affects letter assignment, not the input ordering — the test
suite pins this contract.

## AX filter chain

AX trees for non-trivial apps (especially web-shell / Electron
apps like Cursor / VSCode / Slack) routinely contain hundreds of
role-bearing nodes that *aren't* visible click targets — wrapper
divs, scrolled-out content, hidden modal backers. Labeling all
of them gives the user a wall of pills floating over empty
space. `AXSource.enumerate()` composes five filters to whittle
the raw AX tree down to "what's actually on screen and clickable":

1. **`kAXVisibleChildren` walk** — when a container exposes
   `kAXVisibleChildrenAttribute`, recurse through it instead of
   `kAXChildrenAttribute`. Scroll areas / web areas / outlines
   honour the attribute and only return their visible subset,
   so we stop walking through scrolled-out subtrees before per-
   node attribute reads kick in. The walker also tracks whether
   it has crossed into an `AXWebArea`; once it has, the recursion
   depth ceiling lifts from 32 → 64 for the rest of that subtree.
   Chromium / WKWebView trees routinely bury clickable leaves
   40+ levels below the web-area root, well past the native cap
   — keep the cap for the rest of the native UI but relax it
   locally inside web content. Surfaces in the log as
   `ax: web-area entered at depth=N → maxDepth 32 → 64`.
2. **Role allow-list** — only nodes whose `kAXRole` is in
   `[behavior].roles` (Button, MenuItem, Link, Tab, …) survive.
3. **`supportsPress`** — the node must advertise
   `kAXPressAction` or `kAXShowMenuAction`. Eliminates
   role-bearing-but-inert containers that web shells expose as
   "Button" without an actual click path.
4. **`insideWindow`** — the node's frame *centre* must be inside
   the focused window's bounds. The window bounds come from
   `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` (Quartz's view of what's on
   screen), intersected with `NSScreen.main.visibleFrame`
   (excludes menu bar + Dock). The latter clamp catches apps
   that over-report their AX window frame to span the full
   screen even when the visually-rendered window is smaller.
5. **`dedupNearOverlaps`** — when several nodes share the same
   top-left (within 8 points), keep the first depth-first hit
   and drop the rest. Either ancestor or leaf fires the same
   AX action, so collapsing the stack is safe.

A diagnostic line lands in `/tmp/perch.log` on every enumerate:

```
ax: bounds cg=(…) ax=(…) → filter=(…)
ax: enumerated N hint(s) in <bundle-id>
ax: de-dup M → N
```

— invaluable when triaging "pills outside / over wrong elements"
reports.

## CLI surface (M1)

| Flag | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | server | run the daemon (hotkey loop) |
| `--validate` | standalone | parse `~/.config/perch/config.toml`, exit 0/2 |
| `--doctor` | standalone | health check; exit 0/1 |
| `--dump-ax` | standalone | print every AX element perch's filter chain would label (one line each) |
| `--dump-ax-tree` | standalone | print the raw AX tree depth-first, pre-filter (for "doesn't even reach the filter chain" triage — web view content, Electron content areas) |
| `--activate` | client | show hint overlay now (CLI mirror of the hotkey) |
| `--scroll` | client | enter scroll mode (`j/k/d/u/gg/G`, `esc` to exit) |
| `--search` | client | enter search mode (type, `1-9` to pick a match) |
| `--cancel` | client | dismiss whichever mode is up |
| `--reload` | client | tell running daemon to re-read config |
| `--quit` | client | terminate running daemon |
| `--status` | client | dump active hotkey + last activation |
| `--help` | standalone | show help |

Verbose logging is not a flag: set the `PERCH_DEBUG` env var
(e.g. `PERCH_DEBUG=1 perch`) to mirror logs to stderr and enable
the per-walk trace. The dev launcher sets it; a brew/raw launch
stays quiet.

Client commands all talk to the running daemon via
`DistributedNotificationCenter` (notification name
`com.perch.app.control` — deliberately distinct from the bundle
id so the bundle id can change without breaking clients).
Refuse with exit 3 if no daemon is running. `--activate` /
`--scroll` / `--search` / `--cancel` exist so external triggers
(Karabiner, skhd, Raycast script commands) can drive any mode
without giving up perch's built-in Carbon hotkey, and so
shell-script triggers are cheap. All three modes (hint, scroll,
search) are **mutually exclusive** — Controller tears down
whichever is active before starting a new one so the single
session-level KeyTap installs cleanly.

`--status` is one-way the other direction: DNC can't reply, so
the daemon maintains a small status file at `/tmp/perch.status`
that `--status` reads.

## Keyboard input — the second seam

While the overlay is up, keyboard input is captured by `KeyTap`
([Sources/PerchAdapterMacOS/KeyTap.swift](../Sources/PerchAdapterMacOS/KeyTap.swift)),
a session-level `CGEventTap`. The earlier design used an
`NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents` + transient `NSApp.activate(...)`
pair, which captured keys but stole focus from the underlying app
— after AXPress the caret blinked in the wrong window. The tap
swallows the typed letters by returning `nil` from its callback
without ever activating perch, so the target window stays key
throughout the hint flow.

Events with `Cmd` / `Ctrl` / `Option` held are intentionally **not**
swallowed: the user can still `⌘Q` the focused app or `⌘Tab`
away with the overlay up. The cancel key is configurable via
`[hotkey].cancel` (default `"esc"`); the overlay resolves the
name through `HotkeyMonitor.keyCode(for:)`.

## Multi-screen + display-coord conversion

The overlay panel covers the **union of every connected
NSScreen** — not just `NSScreen.main` — so a hint over a window
on a secondary display still lands on a canvas pixel. AX
positions arrive in CG global coordinates anchored to the
*primary* display's top-left; the canvas-local mapping is:

```
canvas_x = CG_x − unionFrame.minX
canvas_y = CG_y − (primaryHeight − unionFrame.maxY)
```

When the primary IS the topmost screen the Y offset is 0 and
the formula collapses to the single-screen identity, so the
multi-screen path is a strict superset. The union is
recomputed on every `show()` so a display
disconnect / reconnect between activations is reflected.

### Y-axis gotcha (lesson learned)

`OverlayCanvas` sets `isFlipped = true` so AX top-left frames
map straight to canvas-local coords. The `NSVisualEffectView`
that sits underneath the painter (for the frosted-glass
background) is NOT flipped — its `CALayer` mask uses Y-up from
bottom-left. **When handing pill rects into the mask path,
flip Y explicitly** (`mask_y = canvasHeight − pill.rect.maxY`).
Skipping this conversion is silent: the painter still draws
labels in the correct place, but the frost shows up mirrored
to the bottom of the canvas. PR #16 was the fix; CLAUDE.md
flags the constraint so future contributors don't reintroduce
it.

## Roadmap

- **M1** *(shipped)* — native AppKit / SwiftUI apps, vim-style
  hint pills with frosted-glass styling, AXPress dispatch,
  CGEventTap key capture (focus-preserving), CLI activation,
  action-mode modifiers (Shift / Cmd / Alt), scroll mode,
  search mode, multi-screen support.
- **M2** — additional AX role coverage (treat
  `kAXChildren`-less custom views as labelable when they
  expose `kAXPressAction`); per-app behavior config
  (issue #37, shipped — `[behavior."<bundle-id>"]` overrides
  `roles`, `min-size`, `auto-click-on-unique` per frontmost
  bundle, falling through to the global `[behavior]` for
  unset keys).
- **M3** — visible region hints (label only inside a chosen
  region of the screen, à la Surfingkeys regional hints).
- **M4+** — Chrome / Electron / WKWebView support via the
  Chromium AX shim. First pass (issue #26): the AX walker
  lifts its depth ceiling once it crosses into an `AXWebArea`;
  the Controller pre-warms the renderer-AX on Chromium app
  activation (issue #28) so the first hotkey after focus-
  change sees the populated page tree rather than just the
  browser chrome; `--dump-ax-tree` exposes the raw tree for
  diagnosing what AX actually reports for a given web shell.
  Later iterations may add per-backend adapters (a
  `PerchAdapterChrome` would converse with Chrome via its
  WebDriver-style protocol) when AX coverage falls short.
